In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. Two parts of a floor need tiling. 
One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long.

Quiz: Write a Server Log Message
In this programming quiz, you’re going to use what you’ve learned about strings
to write a logging message for a server.

You’ll be provided with example data for a user, the time of their visit and the site they accessed. 
You should use the variables provided and the techniques you’ve learned to print a
log message like this one (with the username, url, and timestamp 
replaced with values from the appropriate variables):

Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20.
'''


# username = "Kinari"
# timestamp = "04:50"
# url = "http://petshop.com/pets/mammals/cats"

# TODO: print a log message using the variables above.
# The message should have the same format as this one:
# "Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20."

# print(username + ' accessed the site ' + url + ' at ' + timestamp + '.')

Calculate and print the total sales for the week from the data provided. Print out a string of the form
